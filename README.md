Diskpiggy just makes your images big, scaling them by 500%.


In order to prevent long freezing and overuse of resources, input images are limited to ~10mb max size. Any image over this size is skipped.

(This was a "just for fun" program made on a whim and will likely not be updated. Enjoy as-is and feel free to do whatever you want with it)
